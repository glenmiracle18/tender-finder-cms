scraping link: https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/api/rest/2/search_notices/json?


I am scraping the link: https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/api/rest/2/search_notices/json? and then getting the data I will just bulk upload to sanity so that
from there I can use it to fetch for react that will be used to display the data.
