It can break the repeated cycle of homelessness that many people experience.  Whilst gaining employment alone may not completely eradicate homelessness, it is an important factor in addressing the issue. Employment provides individuals with the means to secure or maintain their housing and to become more financially independent, it can offer a pathway to stability and security, as well as health benefits. To achieve this end, the provision of advice and support for those who are homeless or at risk of losing their home, to help them find work or to gain the qualifications, work experience, confidence and job skills needed to secure paid employment, is very important. On this regard, the Council is seeking to award a contract for the provision of Employment Advice Provision for the Homeless.\r\n",

The plan will focus on:\r\n\r\n•\tMeasuring the programme's outcomes and overall impact in a structured and evidence-based manner.\r\n•\tInforming future commissioning decisions, ensuring resources are directed toward the most effective and impactful services.\r\n•\tSupporting the development of the Council's new Early Help Offer, explicitly identifying which services should be expanded, modified, or scaled back based on insights gathered during the evaluation of pilot projects.\r\n\r\nThis work is expected to provide robust, actionable insights to help the Council optimise service delivery, maximise the benefits of its investments, and achieve sustainable positive outcomes for its stakeholders.  The Council's detailed requirements are defined in Section 2: Specification.",

The aim of the 16+ Supported Accommodation Services is to provide supported accommodation that promote independence and preparation for adulthood for 16-17-year-old children in care and 18-25-year-old care leavers.\r\n\r\nThe Service is divided into 13 (thirteen) Lots. Successful participants will be able to participate in providing more than one Lot, as appropriate. However, only up to two bidders will be appointed under the two Block Booking Lots. Bidders may apply for and participate in the provision of more than one Lot of the rest of the Lots, subject to the terms of the Framework Agreement. However, only up to 25 Bidders will be appointed under these Lots. From those applying for Block Booking Lots, only those ranked up to two will be awarded the Framework Agreements.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Framework Agreement is for an initial term of 3 years. The contracting authority, at its absolute sole discretion, may exercise an option to extend the Framework Agreement at the end of the initial term for a further one (1) year period subject to the terms of the Framework Agreement and satisfactory performance of the framework providers.\r\n\r\nThe estimated total contract value for the thirteen (13) Lots, plus any required additional support hours, is approximately 28,000,000.00 GBP over the 4 years period (including optional extension). The estimated total values for each Lot are: Lot 1 = 16,800,000 GBP, Lot 2 = 1,400,000 GBP, Lot 3 = 280,000 GBP, Lot 4 = 280,000 GBP, Lot 5 = 1,400,000 GBP, Lot 6 = 280,000 GBP, Lot 7 = 5,600,000 GBP, Lot 8 = 280,000 GBP, Lot 9 = 280,000 GBP, Lot 10 = 280,000 GBP, Lot 11 = 280,000 GBP, Lot 12 = 280,000 GBP, and Lot 13 = 280,000 GBP.  &#xA3;280,000 is expected to be spent on additional support hours that might be purchased across all Lots as necessary throughout the terms of the Framework Agreement.\r\n\r\nThere will be no form of exclusivity or volume that is guaranteed under the resultant Framework Agreement and the contracting authority will be entitled to enter into other contracts and arrangements with other suppliers for the provision of any, or all, of the requirements which are the same as, or similar to those specified under the established Framework Agreement.\r\n\r\nThe procurement is being run as a two-stage process with a pre-selection stage using the core elements of the Standard Selection Questionnaire. A second stage, where shortlisted candidates will be invited to tender will follow. Therefore, during the first stage of the procurement, candidates ranking up to 5 will be shortlisted and invited to bid for the Block Booking Lots and candidates ranking up to 35 will be shortlisted and invited to bid for the rest of the Lots, based on the total scores the candidates achieve in Te",

In addition, the Council owns approximately 140 existing LED lights of varying ages and specification. \r\n\r\nThe Council is also looking for concurrent implementation of a Central Management System (to be managed by the successful bidder) that will allow real time or near-real time fault self-reporting across our entire lighting stock. The Central Management System must also support bespoke, programmable, part-night lighting and/or dimming profiles on a column-by-column or street-by-street basis. \r\n\r\nLastly, we require all of the above to be managed and maintained by the successful bidder, for the duration of the contract. \r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this tender is for one agreement, divided into three parts, none of which are &quot;lots&quot;: \r\n\r\nPart 1:\tConversion of Sprowston Town Council&#039;s non-LED Streetlights to LEDs of a specification suitable for footway lighting, as per the Highways Act 1980 \r\n\r\nPart 2: \tSupply and installation of a Central Management System (CMS) for the entirety of Town Council&#039;s lighting stock (including the newly converted LEDs and any pre-existing LEDs)\r\n\r\nPart 3:\tAnnual management and maintenance of Sprowston Town Council&#039;s streetlights (including the newly converted LEDs and any pre-existing LEDs - as per part 1) and the new Central Management System (as per part 2).\r\n\r\n\r\nContract to be issued by 12th March 2025, with the project to commence as soon as possible after that date.\r\n\r\nThis tender is divided into three Parts.

                "description": "ECW was formerly known as the Cheshire & Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership (C&W LEP). It is also responsible for promoting Cheshire and Warrington as a great place to visit, live, work, invest and study through Marketing Cheshire, which is an integral part of ECW and is designated by Visit England as the sub-region's Local Visitor Economy Partnership (LVEP).\r\n\r\nFollowing completion of our recent 'Delivery of the North West Industrial Decarbonisation Cluster Plan' workstream, and support to Net Zero North West to establish its new business model, ECW are looking to further support the delivery of industrial decarbonisation alongside Net Zero North West (NZNW) and the North West Net Zero Hub via the creation of a comprehensive data platform (Project Intelligence Platform - PIP). \r\n\r\nThe Platform is required to enable the industrial decarbonisation cluster to have access to as comprehensive and usable set of data as possible about the industrial decarbonisation projects in the pipeline and ultimately underway/delivered. This will ensure that the cluster can continue to realise the investment required, support the job creation, and carbon reduction goals essential for our regional transition to a low-carbon economy and the platform itself will need to enable the wider partnership to measure and demonstrate progress / success to wider stakeholders such as government and investors. \r\n\r\nThis procurement exercise is being conducted as a below threshold open tender. The tender documents comprise this ITT document and any other supporting documents. This procurement seeks specialist support from a high-quality supplier to deliver the development (stage 1) and population (stage 2) of a comprehensive Project Intelligence Platform (PIP).\r\n\r\nThe successful bidder will be required to deliver services in accordance with all tender documents and the contract to be placed with the successful bidder. Tenderers are requested to study the specification in detail and ensure that the specified requirements can be met and thus your understanding of our requirements is reflected in your Pricing Schedule return. \r\n\r\nThe contract is expected to commence Wednesday 16th January 2025 with the exact dates to be agreed depending on the agreement between the successful provider and ECW.",

Whilst smoking rates have declined significantly over the past decade, smoking is still considered the biggest cause of preventable illness and premature death in the UK, accounting for over 64,000 deaths every year. It is estimated that smoking costs England &#xA3;17.3 Billion per year, &#xA3;3 Billion of which falls upon Health and Social care. Smoking is also a main cause of health inequalities, responsible for half of the difference in life expectancy between the least and most deprived areas.\r\nThe project has been developed specifically focused on working in the town of Corby, which has a large Routine and Manual workforce (%), higher than the national average. The project is being developed and implemented through the Local Area Partnership for Corby, which brings together local stakeholders invested improving health and wellbeing of local communities. The project aims to gather insight to understand the drivers of smoking at a community level, develop local solutions to improve the number of people seeking to stop smoking, and ensure local stop smoking services are acceptable and accessible. \r\n\r\nFor this stage of the project, we seek a Supplier to help obtain valuable insights through qualitative and quantitative market research related to smoking in Routine and Manual workers and communities, within Corby.\r\n\r\nPlease Note: The sample sizes included within the specification are not set in stone. Whilst we hope that prospective suppliers could achieve these targets, we will consider alternative proposals providing they are within the set budget.\r\n\r\nTo apply please read and complete the E-Quotation Form and return this before the closing date as stated in the document.",

                "description": "Objective\r\n\r\nLebanon has faced a series of crises in recent years, including a financial collapse, the Beirut port explosion, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent conflict with Israel. These events have deepened pre-existing challenges, leaving the Lebanese population facing an uncertain future in a fragmented and unstable country.\r\n\r\nIn response to these crises and the future polycrisis Lebanon faces, this research aims to explore the intergenerational perspectives of Lebanese people regarding the social contract for future generations. The study will focus on their collective aspirations for a new social contract, examining their visions for political, economic, and social reforms, as well as the fundamental rights they consider essential for a sustainable, just, inclusive and resilient future where the relationship between the state and society is underpinned by trust and participation.\r\n\r\nThe research will provide insights into both shared and divergent perspectives on governance, economic structures, and societal relations, ultimately identifying a path toward a more stable, just, and inclusive Lebanon.\r\n\r\nThe findings will be shared with key stakeholders, including policymakers, members of Parliament, and relevant institutions, to initiate a national dialogue on a resilient social contract for future generations.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the research will seek to answer the following key questions, which will be refined in collaboration with the selected  consultant:\r\n\r\n1.\tWhat visions for Lebanon&#039;s future, in terms of political, economic, and social stability, do the different generations articulate, and where do their views align, diverge, or conflict?\r\n2.\tHow do different generations view the relationship between citizens and the state? How do they believe this should work to best serve their needs and interests?\r\n3.\tWhat core values, rights, and principles do the different generations consider essential for a sustainable, just, inclusive and resilient future in Lebanon?\r\n4.\tWhat key barriers and opportunities different generations identify as obstacles to implementing a new social contract in Lebanon?\r\n\r\nThe consultant will work in close coordination with WFD&#039;s project team to ensure the research process remains adaptive and responsive to any evolving needs or challenges.\r\n\r\nInterested parties should prepare their proposal in two phases. The first phase is expected to conclude by the end of March 2025 and will begin as soon as possible, with a value of &#xA3;15,000. The second phase, subject to funding and contract approval, is expected to last no longer than 12 months, from March 2025 to March 2026.\r\n\r\nDeliverables\r\n1.\tAn agreed detailed work-plan and methodology for the consultancy \r\n2.\tResearch guide for the project\r\n3.\tDraft and final written reports providing in-depth analysis and implications of findings \r\n\r\nPlease read the tender notice for a detailed scope of work and more information on how to apply.",

The field includes a fenced play area for children, containing various items of play equipment.  However, many of the items are constructed of wood and now require additional maintenance because of their deteriorating condition.  The Council has resolved to replace those existing items which will soon need to be decommissioned for safety reasons, and will look to instal replacements made of metal rather than wood to both extend their working lives and reduce future routine maintenance costs.The Council invites qualified contractors (&quot;Bidders&quot;) with proven and demonstrable experience in the delivery of similar projects to tender for the provision of new modern play equipment suitable for children up to at least the age of 12 in the play area, including utilisation of the existing mound feature, seating for supervising adults and all-weather pathways between items of equipment to facilitate all year-round use.  A small number of existing  items made of metal (see Section B - Specification) may be retained and should be incorporated into the new overall design.  Bidders should focus on play values, inclusivity, sustainability and value-for-money, taking account of the Council&#039;s detailed specifications which have been based on user consultations.\r\nThe Council anticipates the play area to be completely closed while the works are being completed and the Bidder is expected to be responsible for security of the works within and the boundary of the site during this time.  In addition, because of the proximity of the site to neighbouring residential properties work should be restricted to daylight hours between 7.00 am and 7.00 pm and follow these additional limitations:\r\n•\tMonday to Friday, 7.00 am to 8.00 am - Light work only, and no excessively noisy work.\r\n•\t\tMonday to Friday, 6.00 pm to 7.00 pm - Light work only, and no excessively noisy work.\r\n•\tSaturdays, 8.00 am to 1.00 pm - All types of work permitted.\r\n•\tSaturdays, 7.00 am to 8.00 am &amp; 1.00 pm to 7.00 pm - No work that can be heard beyond the site&#039;s boundary.\r\n•\tSundays and Bank Holidays - No work that can be heard beyond the site&#039;s boundary.\r\nWork outside of these hours will only be permitted with prior permission from the Council.\r\nA.3\tCONFIDENTIALITY\r\nA.3.1\tThe Bidder must treat bid documentation as private and confidential.\r\nA.3.2\tThe Bidder must not disclose to third parties:\r\n•\tdetails of the proposed Contract;\r\n•\ttheir bid in whole or in part prior to the award of the Contract by the Council;\r\n•\treceipt of notification that their bid has not been accepted as",

As such the selected provider must be willing and able to work flexibly &amp; collaboratively with us on that basis.\r\nWe recognise that this is an innovative approach and that no single organisation may be able to achieve this alone, so we would very much welcome consortia bids that can demonstrate the range of skills, knowledge and experience we need to deliver this change.\r\nFurther information and tender documents are available on our e-tendering portal https://lbbd.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.shtml\r\nAny questions regarding the tender should be addressed through the portal in the messaging section.\r\nClosing date 12 noon on Friday 31st January 2025",

                "description": "The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has a worldwide inventory of around 5,700 post-1870 military shipping wrecks mainly dating from World War I and II. These wrecks are managed by the Salvage and Marine Operations (SALMO) team through the Wreck Management Programme (WMP), which monitors and assesses the environmental and safety concerns associated with post 1870 MOD wrecks.\r\n\r\nIn 1918 HMS CASSANDRA was part of a British force dispatched to the Baltic as part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. On 5 December 1918 while en-route to Tallinn, CASSANDRA struck a mine and sank one hour later. The wreck of HMS CASSANDRA lies 36 kms west of Vilsandi, Estonia at a water depth of 95 - 100 meters.\r\n\r\nThis contract is for the provision of services to conduct a wreck survey of HMS CASSANDRA. The survey shall determine the condition of the vessel and the likely amounts of pollutants/ammunition remaining onboard. The survey shall comprise a visual and multibeam echosounder (MBES) examination of the wreck with hull thickness measurements using a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). This will see potential providers provide a turn key solution to the requirement, including provision of a vessel, work class ROV, SQEP personnel to conduct the survey and a written report of the findings. Contractors must have suitable environmental protection measures in place and must secure all necessary permissions from the Estonian government as part of the turnkey solution.\r\n\r\nThe contract duration will be five (5) months to enable mobilisation and survey report delivery.\r\n\r\nEstimated value of overall procurement is &#xA3;791,666.67 (ex VAT).\r\n\r\nThis notice is an opportunity to register an Expression of Interest (EOI) in the procurement. To be invited to the next stage of this procurement please send your EOI to DESShipsComrcl-SALMO-Multiuser@mod.gov.uk by 13/01/2025, 17:00hr. Failure to respond will exclude you from any possible future competition for this requirement.\r\n\r\nTentative dates to note (subject to change):\r\nInvitation to Tender (ITT) - January 2025\r\nContract Award - April 2025",

The business originally traded from a small unit in The Fradgan, located behind the Fish Market, close to the Old Post Office, right in the centre of historic Newlyn. \r\n\r\nA two-storey building at Tolcarne was also used as a maintenance base for fishing vessels, transport and property as well as for cold storage. The current Coombe headquarters were taken over unit by unit from neighbours as they retired or moved on. This building has always been associated with the fishing industry. Salt was shovelled into one large store and this was used to cure the locally caught pilchards; alongside the salt store, stables were provided for horses used to transport fish from boats landing on beaches; haylofts were used above the stables; at the southern end were fish packing stores. \r\n\r\nThe business had sole ownership in 1974 and adapted this building into a retail outlet, cooking, processing, storage and administration unit, whilst still retaining its historic charm and continues to source, cook and handpick crab meat and shellfish.\r\n\r\nThis project is to help W Harvey &amp; Sons Limited to with its CO2E reduction.\r\nThe purchase of this system is part of a grant funded application process and therefore procurement will be subject to grant approval of the project. We will assess tenders received on a Most Economically Advantageous Tender for Lot 1 (PV system) and the lowest compliant bid for Lot 2 (batteries).",

This notice is in relation to Category 5 Shared Lives.\r\n\r\nEstimated Total Aggregate Value across the lifetime of the DPV for Category 5 is &#xA3;16,521,691.\r\n\r\nShared Lives provides a community-based living option for adults with support needs who seek a more homely and inclusive environment.

Shared Livers provides an alternative to traditional care settings, promoting greater independence and social inclusion. The Authority seeks to commission Shared Lives Service(s) offering a flexible and individualised approach to empower individuals with diverse needs who desire a more homely and inclusive living environment. \r\n\r\nService specifications for category 5 are not available to view at admission stage, but core information relevant to the service specification is included in &#039;The Service Brief&#039; document.\r\n\r\nThis should give providers enough information to decide whether they want to apply for admission to the Supporting Vulnerable Adults DPV - Category 5 Shared Lives.\r\n\r\nThe procurement is being conducted in accordance with Regulation 74 to 76 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015. The procurement is subject to the light-touch regime under Section 7 and as such, the Authority is free to establish a procedure, provided that procedure is sufficient to ensure compliance with the principles of transparency and equal treatment of economic operators (providers).\r\n\r\nThe DPV is open for admission and withdrawal of providers to each category (once launched) and specialism(s) (where applicable) throughout its lifetime. Applications for admission to a category will be assessed in &quot;Rounds&quot; throughout the lifetime of the DPV (further information below).\r\n\r\nProviders applying for admission to a category within a Round will be required to complete and meet minimum standards set out within the procurement documentation.\r\n\r\nThe Estimated Total Aggregate Value for Newham across the lifetime of the DPV is &#xA3;957,356,593.\r\n\r\nThe DPV is open for use to other North East London Boroughs.\r\n\r\nThe Boroughs are: Barking and Dagenham, City of London, Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest.\r\n\r\nEstimated Total Aggregate Value across all local authorities across the lifetime of the DPV is &#xA3;6,701,496,150.",

If necessary, groundworks can be completed in the area. \r\n\r\nWe want the play features to be eye catching, unique, visually attractive and to reflect the natural environment of Fernwood Village. Your offer should provide good imaginative, inclusive and active play value to help us create a play area for children aged 1 to 12 years.\r\nPlease note we are planning to hold a contractor&#039;s question session at Fernwood Villager Hall between 23rd and 24th January 2025.

                "description": "Background:\r\nThe BEEMS (British Energy Estuarine and Marine Studies) programme is funded by Sizewell C Limited. Through this programme, Cefas provide authoritative scientific information on the marine and transitional waters in the vicinity of potential new build nuclear power stations and require the Supplier to deliver the elements described below.\r\n\r\nRequirement:\r\nThe purpose of this project is to provide bathymetric data for the Greater Sizewell Bay (GSB) to assess the geomorphological changes of the region, hence contributing to the ongoing monitoring of the Sizewell Coastline.\r\n\r\nCefas require two Multibeam Echosounder (MBES) bathymetric surveys to IHO Special Order (at a minimum) within the Greater Sizewell Bay (GSB) in 2025. Exact survey locations will be agreed between Cefas and the supplier during the pre-survey kick off meetings.\r\n\r\nSurvey 1 will be in April 2025 and will require nearshore transects to be undertaken to assess the geomorphological changes shown by two longshore bars. Therefore, care should be taken to maximise landward extent, and the survey should be undertaken during a Spring tide window to extend the coverage in the landward sense as far as practicable. Three further East to West Corridors (&#039;Radar Calibration Corridors&#039;) are included in the scope for Multibeam survey (Figure 1).\r\n\r\nFor areas of survey overlap between nearshore or calibration corridors, the expectation is that coverage shall only be acquired once, and hence supplier&#039;s should provide details of a proposed survey plan to meet this requirement and ensure that there are no gaps in coverage.\r\nSurvey 2 would be undertaken in July 2025. The final area to be surveyed will be confirmed by Cefas in spring 2025, but will broadly cover the area between the two lines in Figure 2. The expected maximum survey extent would be 2 km2 but this may be reduced once areas of interest are identified, so therefore expected that this survey to be costed per day. This survey is likely to be required on spring tides to enable any shallow water areas to be accessed.\r\nSurvey Strategy:\r\nCefas aim to confirm the finalised survey areas in a kick-off meeting with the supplier prior to each of the surveys. The supplier should note that the survey due to occur in April 2025 will be required on Spring Tides. The supplier should provide a line plan two weeks prior to the survey for Cefas to review and provide comment. The regular system of sounding lines shall be supplemented by a series of crosslines for verifying and evaluating the accuracy and reliability of surveyed depths and plotted locations in April. In July, a survey plan and/or dynamic line plans will be required but can be provided nearer the time of survey. The spacing between crosslines should typically be no more than 15 times that of the main sounding lines.\r\nFor full details Download the Bidder Pack at https://defra-family.force.com/s/Welcome and search for CEFAS24-145 under opportunities.",

This Invitation to Tender invites architectural practices to provide detailed design and construction-stage support. The scope includes RIBA Stages 4 (Technical Design), 5 (Construction), and 6 (Handover).\r\nSTC has already procured, and owns a license for, a design concept that has been worked up by a previous architect to RIBA Stage 3. This design was used to gain planning and funding approval from Dorset Council (DC) for STC to deliver the Hub. STC owns the license for this design, and it is made freely available, in detail, for all tenderers to provide architectural services for its delivery. This is referred to as the Approved Design \r\nTenderers must submit a &#039;Base Case&#039; tender to provide architectural services to deliver that Approved Design. \r\nHowever, STC is also keen to receive alternative proposals that either optimise the approved design or constitute a new design, in order to fulfil STC&#039;s objectives for the Hub, and/or provide cost savings. Section 7 outlines how any alternative proposals will be considered. \r\nThe Mampitts Community Hub project is being funded by S106 Developer Contributions overseen by Dorset Council. The project is set with funding conditions and is in line with Dorset Council S106 protocol for community schemes.  \r\n\r\nIf companies require additional time to submit a proposal (noting the closing date is 31st January 2025) then a formal request needs to be submitted to the Town Clerk by 13th January 2025.\r\n\r\nSubmissions should be emailed to \r\nconfidential@shaftesbury-tc.gov.uk. \r\nHard copies (to supplement electronic submission) may be delivered to: Shaftesbury Town Council, Town Hall, High Street, Shaftesbury SP7 8LY marked &#039;tender private and confidential.&#039;",

This will allow it to cover the wide range of material in the Museum collection and those from collaborators under the RICHeS programme.\r\n      \r\n      The Museum wishes to procure the instrument, and all necessary supporting equipment and software, as set out in greater detail below in the specification. The procurement will also include delivery and installation of the instrument in the Museum&#039;s X-ray laboratory suite in its World Conservation and Exhibition Centre (WCEC) at its main site in Bloomsbury, London. The supplier will conduct all necessary post installation tests of functionality and provide training to the RICHeS staff on use of the instrument. Post warranty maintenance services will also be provided as part of the contract.\r\n      \r\n      The grant provides a budget of &#xA3;710,000 (excluding VAT) for the purchase of the instrument, supporting computing hardware and software, delivery, installation, training and for a maintenance and service contract to last 5 years post installation.",

                "description": "The Climate Finance Accelerator (CFA) is part of the UK Government&amp;apos;s efforts to support climate action at scale. The program seeks to improve the quality of emerging green businesses and initiatives in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies and matches them to relevant investors. It also fosters action to address relevant policy and regulatory barriers.\r\n \r\nSince 2020, the CFA has supported 233 projects across 10 countries, with the first 50 securing deals worth over $400m. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) is currently procuring a Global Supplier to deliver the next five-year phase of the CFA (CFA 2), which is expected to support at least a further 800 projects in 16 countries.\r\n \r\nThis procurement exercise aims to source a supplier to act as an Evaluation Partner for CFA 2. Evaluation activities are essential given the continued evolution, enlarged scope, and expanded duration of CFA, which increases the opportunities to build and share the evidence base for capacity building programs. Climate accelerator programs are increasing in number, though CFA continues to be differentiated in its ability to link entrepreneurs with public and private stakeholders across multiple sectors, geographies, and project types, and its focus on more mature projects that are seeking commercial investment rather than earlier-stage projects seeking pre-seed support. Opportunities to test the CFA relevance and additionality in a dynamic climate finance landscape will be key to its continued relevance, impact, and value.\r\n \r\nThis requirement is being sourced via the Open procedure under PCR (2015).\r\n \r\nThe contract is estimated to commence in June 2025 and end in December 2029.\r\n \r\nThe contract value will be up to &#xA3;1,000,000 excluding UK VAT but including all other taxes. \r\n \r\nThere is an option to extend, by an additional 36 months and &#xA3;3,050,000 excluding UK VAT but including all other taxes. Bringing the maximum potential contract value to &#xA3;4,050,000 excluding UK VAT but including all other taxes.\r\n \r\nPlease register on our e-sourcing tool Jaggaer: https://beisgroup.ukp.app.jaggaer.com to participate in the tendering exercise.",

The new Local Development Scheme (October 2024) aims for submission of the new Local Plan by January 2026 with an adoption date by December 2026. Currently, the Council has begun to compile its evidence base which will help inform the new Local Plan and is engaging on the content and scope of the Local Plan, and how it will address the challenges facing the city. A call for sites has also been issued.\r\nThe current Infrastructure Delivery Programme Update was prepared in 2019 to support the examination of the Liverpool Local Plan 2013-2033. The programme identified the ability of each type of infrastructure to support the delivery of the proposed housing and employment growth across the city.\r\nThe Infrastructure Delivery Programme Update 2019 examined the quality and capacity of the following types of infrastructure in Liverpool:\r\n•\tTransport\r\n•\tEducation\r\n•\tHealth and healthcare\r\n•\tUtilities\r\n•\tDigital infrastructure and connectivity\r\n•\tFlood risk and drainage\r\n•\tWaste management\r\n•\tGreen infrastructure\r\n•\tSport, leisure and recreation\r\n•\tCommunity and cultural\r\n•\tEmergency services\r\nAs it has been over 5 years since the last update was produced, there is now a requirement to prepare a new Infrastructure Delivery Plan for the city which assesses the current levels of infrastructure and any proposed investment in new infrastructure.\r\n",

We need to monitor national, regional and trade coverage in print, broadcast and online. We would also be interested in the possibility of monitoring international coverage. It should be a reliable service which covers a multitude of keywords that can be easily adapted based on our changing campaigns (and ideally at no extra cost). We would expect any supplier to have an extensive source list.\r\n      We need to be able to demonstrate all coverage achieved in clear, succinct and eye-catching ways, including our regional coverage volumes which should be broken down by key English regions.\r\n      We currently monitor and &quot;tag&quot; our coverage by theme, based on various areas of our work. This is done automatically through the media monitoring software and can also be done manually in the platform. This allows us to demonstrate how stories related to different themes of our work perform against each other, or which areas of our work the media cover most regularly. We would like this function to continue, or for a sensible replacement of this feature to be proposed.\r\n      We need for a team of 10-12 colleagues to be able to access the platform and receive regular training for using the platform/getting the most out of the service. We also require that 15-20 people receive daily coverage alerts which are easy to read, broken down in a sensible way for quick accessibility, ideally with a one sentence or more summary for each headline in the roundup.\r\n      We collate a summary of gained coverage for our organization every day. For this we share all manner of coverage, including broadcast clippings, so we require a quick and easy way to edit and share broadcast clippings within the platform.\r\n      We would expect a high level of customer service support, with a named contact available to handle any issues we&#039;re having at any time. \r\n      The contract for this would need to commence 1 July 2025. Duration 3 year. Renewable annually at Historic England&#039;s discretion. Three months&#039; notice period.\r\n      We also need to source a media database so the media team can research journalists and outlets across the UK to promote our stories. \r\n      The database needs to be extensive with contacts for national, regional, local and trade outlets in the UK and, possibly international. Information about journalists and outlets should include contact details, subject areas covered and preferred method of contact. This database should be updated regularly. \r\n      We need to be able to create themed lists of contacts within the database, which can be shared with all users at Historic England and also have the ability to add private contacts to the database. \r\n      The media monitoring and database could be bid for separately or together. We will not give preference to either unless combining the two services provides additional benefits such as a discount ...",

Priority Places are areas where investment and engagement in the arts have historically been low, yet significant opportunities exist for impactful cultural development. This project seeks to strengthen Barking and Dagenham&#039;s cultural infrastructure by establishing a new arts centre - Galleon Arts Centre - to aid the borough&#039;s cultural development and support creative practitioners. \r\n\r\nFollowing the closure of the arts centre under previous ownership in 2023, the Arts Council and Barking and Dagenham Council have supported the continuation of a core cultural programme. The next phase of development will build on this to fully re-activate the centre as a vibrant, financially sustainable space that supports access to cultural activities for local people and acts as a resource for the creative and artistic community in the borough. \r\n\r\nThe Council intends to award the contract to a supplier who meet the council&#039;s requirements\r\n\r\nFurther information and tender documents are available on our e-tendering portal https://lbbd.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.shtml \r\n\r\nAny questions regarding the tender should be addressed through the portal in the messaging section.\r\n\r\nClosing date 5pm on Wednesday 15th January 2025",

                "description": "The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park was home to the 2012 London Olympic Games. The Lee Valley Regional Park Authority is now the proud owner of two of the venues based on the park: The Lee Valley VeloPark and The Lee Valley Hockey &amp; Tennis Centre. LVRPA owns an area of land that currently has around 36,000m2 of resin bonded &#039;Gold Top&#039; surfacing. Much of the resin bonded surface is now showing signs of deterioration and requires stripping up and replacing. The substrate is mainly concrete laid to falls and the areas generally drain into Acco drainage channels. There are some additional areas of resin bound surfaces, but these are fairly small in terms of square metreage. The resin bound areas are porous and generally drain through holes drilled through the substrate into the ground below.\r\n      \r\n      This project is for the phased replacement of the Gold Top areas on a priority basis. It is envisaged that the Authority will split the 36,000m2 into approx. 4500m2/annum over an 8 phase period (one phase per financial year). The contractor will be required to remeasure areas on completion and works will be paid on a square metre basis.\r\n      \r\n      The first phase of works will be scheduled to take place in March/April 2025 due to financial reasons but generally it is envisaged that the following phases will be carried out in May/June each year with the second phase being a &#039;follow on&#039; to phase 1 in 2025.\r\n      \r\n      The contractor should price for each phase separately and in doing so allow a nominal uplift for inflation and material price increases.",

It is anticipated value in the range of &#xA3;400,000-&#xA3;645,000. \r\n      \r\n      The objectives of this work are:\r\n      To procure business breakdown and contact details, construct an appropriate sampling frame and survey a sample - representative by sector (SIC code) and business size - of businesses across Northern Ireland. It is not possible to confirm the exact number of companies that will be targeted in the sample frame prior to the statistical work being undertaken by the successful contractor in scoping and developing sample frame options. Therefore, tenderers are requested to provide an estimated price based on 1,500 surveys.\r\n      To provide WRAP and DAERA with robust data on the quantity of solid waste (including material entering preparation for reuse) arising from businesses in the Commercial and Industrial sectors in 2024.\r\n      To provide a breakdown of the waste arising by industrial sector and commercial sector, and by each of the major subsectors within Northern Ireland.\r\n      To provide detailed analysis of the composition of the waste arising by sector and subsector, using an approach based on the Subject Oriented Classification (SOC) approach based on European Waste Catalogue (EWC) codes.\r\n      To provide a breakdown of the waste management end destinations (e.g. preparation for reuse, recycling, composting, energy from waste or landfill) of waste arising by sector, subsector and SOC.",

The contract will be an initial 5 years with 4 additional option years to be taken in 1 year increments at the Authorities discretion and have a value of approximately &#xA3;551,000 (Ex VAT).\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the provisions of The Public Procurement (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 SI No. 2020/1319, this procurement falls to be regulated under the provisions of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 as amended (in particular by SI 2020/1319).  Prior publication of a contract notice in the Official Journal of the European Union is no longer appropriate. It is considered that the award of the contract without prior publication of a contract notice in the UK e-notification service (as required by the relevant legislation) is lawful in accordance with regulation 32(2)(b)(ii) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 because competition is absent for technical reasons.\r\n \r\nThis is because Fumecare is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the Cabinet and has supported it since it was introduced into service in 1997. Only the OEM has the drawings, information, technical expertise, and tools necessary to support this critically important piece of safety equipment which is used to remove toxic dust, fumes and aerosol vapours when testing aircraft components for early signs of failure such as cracks and metal fatigue. In particular, due to the age of the Cabinet, certain of its key electronic components are now obsolete and only the OEM has the expertise to upgrade them to the required technical and safety standards.",

Increasing activity around the Museum&#039;s masterplan, and the arrival of a new museum Director in 2024 makes now the right moment to consider our vision and values, review our brand and move forward with a compelling new approach to how we communicate and present ourselves. The Brand and Identity Project will deliver this transformation. It is being conducted in two phases. In Phase 1 research will be conducted to understand the Museum&#039;s position in the global context followed by a brand audit leading to the creation of a brand strategy. An agency has been appointed to Phase I and work is now underway. In Phase II, which is the subject of this procurement exercise, we are looking for a partner to work with us to translate our new vision and values, and the brand strategy developed in Phase I, into a coherent and compelling visual and vocal identity.  This identity should comprise a clear system that conveys the brand idea and narrative in such a way that it can be used and applied consistently to internal and external products and services, across our many audiences, locally, nationally, and globally.",

In some instances, fetal sexing is performed in addition to the main trisomy&#039;s. The SAFE test has been set up as a collaboration between the Fetal Medicine Unit and the St George&#039;s Genomics Service, which is a UKAS accredited medical laboratory. The service provides NIPT to approximately one third of the NHS maternity services in England and several private clinical services performing 4,000-5,000 tests annually. \r\n\r\nThis invitation to tender gives the requirement to supply a complete laboratory test setup including reagent test kits for NIPT, all equipment, associated software and LIMS and equipment servicing. The test should be commercially available and CE marked for In Vitro diagnostic use ideally compliant to ISO13485. It should detect aneuploidy of chromosomes 13, 18 and 21 and be able to determine fetal sex within the specified sensitivity and specificity thresholds as a minimum requirement.\r\n\r\nThe supplier must provide reagents, software and protocols sufficient to produce an end result on suitable equipment designated by the supplier. Resulting data must be clearly reportable and be usable by The SAFE Test personnel in a flexible and secure manner. \r\n\r\nThe service must be provided to diagnostic standards, incorporating a complete CE/IVDD compliant workflow, to ensure data can be used for clinical interpretation. Samples must be analysed within the given timeframe, data must meet the minimum specified requirements and results issued in a customisable and easily interpretable format.  \r\n\r\nThe majority of samples processed are commissioned by NHSE with a contract running until March 2026. In the event St George&#039;s is not re-procured by NHSE to provide this service beyond this point, it is likely that the service may have to terminate its contract with the supplier.",

The one stop shop is an initiative designed to address the gap in support for households in West Yorkshire&#039;s private housing sector, focusing on retrofitting and installing renewable energy solutions. With 82% of the region&#039;s 1.02 million households either owned or privately rented, there is a significant need for assistance in improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. The scheme responds to and delivers on the Mayor of West Yorkshire&#039;s manifesto, to establish a one stop shop (OSS) in West Yorkshire.  The OSS aims to provide a comprehensive, accessible service to support households through the retrofit process, addressing barriers to uptake and promoting sustainable energy use. By offering direct support and raising awareness of existing schemes, the OSS will enable these households to contribute to the region&#039;s overall sustainability goals and help achieve West Yorkshire&#039;s ambitious Net Zero target by 2038. The purpose of this commission is to appoint a contractor to manage and deliver the OSS and its services, which will support West Yorkshire residents and private landlords to improve the energy efficiency of their home through installation of retrofit measures acting as a &#039;managing agent&#039;. The managing agent will provide both advice and installation services. Consortium bids are permitted, with a consortium lead clearly identified.  The contract is to be for an initial 5 year term with the option to extend up to a maximum period of 15 years. \r\n\r\nNote: Estimated contracted expenditure by the Combined Authority (CA) as a result of the award of this contract opportunity is in relation to the provision of a managing agent service for advice only. The awarded opportunity will also allow for the provision of installation services/works to the public as a consequence. However, such services/works are not deemed to be capable of being exclusively exploited by the awarded provider, and the CA will not control provision of these services/works. It is deemed that this procurement and resulting Contract arrangements, Contract expenditure and Contract risk is in accordance and subject to Public Contract Regulations 2015 and does not satisfy the criteria or definitions of a concession set out in Contract Concession Regulations 2016.

                "description": "After working for Kath Hawkins, the previous owner and founder of The Honey Pot, I took on the business in July 2017. From as early as I can remember, my life has revolved around food - and the jobs I was drawn to from the age of 16 involved producing, cooking or serving it - so falling into the caf&#xE9; scene at the eager age of 25 was hardly a surprise. My aim in taking on The Honey Pot, a small caf&#xE9; in the heart of Penzance was to maintain the incredibly high standards set by Kath - in the flavours of the cooking, the quality of service and attention to detail - and to make sure the ethos of the business was respected and continued into the next generation.\r\n\r\nTo renovate the building and redesign the kitchen and restaurant in order to overcome significant limitations. The layout of the kitchen is inefficient and has been poorly designed with much wasted space. Cramped workspace limits the number of staff I can employ and restricts the capacity for growing the business. I want to open up the restaurant to create a usable space for workshops, events and community projects.\r\nThis is part of a grant funded application process and therefore procurement will be subject to grant approval of the project. We will assess tenders received on lowest compliant Tender.",

It is anticipated that the contracts will commence on 25/03/2025 for the non- Section 20 Lots and 25/04/2025 for the Section 20 Lots \r\n      The proposed lots are as follows\r\n      Lot 1: Voids (Non-S20) \r\n      Lot 2:Disrepair (S20) \r\n      Lot 3: Repairs (S20)\r\n      Lot 4: Damp and Mould (S20) \r\n      Lot 5: Windows and Doors (S20) \r\n      Lot 6: Roofing (S20) \r\n      Lot 7: Drainage (S20) \r\n      Lot 8: Out Of Hours General (Non-S20) \r\n      Lot 9: Out Of Hours Electrical (Non-S20) \r\n      The Client intends to enter into a single Contract for each lot (with the exception of Voids which will be two contracts) The Contract term is for 3 years plus up to a further 2 years. There will be no form of exclusivity or volume that is guaranteed under the Contract Agreement. The contract values may flex appropriately as required as required by the Council to suit the Council&#039;s need for support during the term. The scope of work for each lot will cover a range of building and maintenance trades to complete high quality repairs to Council owned domestic properties as normally carried out by the in-house Repairs and Voids teams. The council reserves the right to carry out in house any repair type/trade that is the same or similar to the works being done under the contracts if it feels it will generate better value for community it serves and as such this is likely to reduce the level of external contractor support needed. The Contracts will be let on an &quot;all-inclusive&quot; basis incorporating the National Housing Federation Schedule of Rates.",

In April 2024 it launched its five-year Corporate Plan, the organisation&#039;s first ever comprehensive People Strategy, and Equality Objectives. Our health and safety policy outlines the objectives to enable good management of health, safety, and statutory wellbeing risks and opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the People Strategy is to create an exceptional work environment over the next five years. This will be underpinned by personal and collective accountability resulting in excellent performance, equality, equity, diversity, and inclusion, as well as health and safety across the entire organisation. One of the programmes to be delivered will be an organisation wide initiative to co-create overarching values and behaviours that consider, retain, and respect our individual institutions&#039; values. Alongside this a culture map analysing organisational maturity and next steps will be developed as part of the outputs with a focus on culture change, enabling our employees to establish City Corporation as a world-class organisation. \r\n\r\nThe City Corporation&#039;s People Strategy will deliver meaningful change over the next five years and by 2029 our people will:\r\n- be supported, challenged, and motivated to do excellent work individually and \r\ncollaboratively with others to achieve exceptional outcomes. \r\n- feel comfortable taking personal responsibility for their individual contributions while being seen as unique with individual and collective strengths and aspirations.\r\n- experience and contribute to a culture where inclusive, equitable, values-led \r\nleadership is consistently role-modelled across all levels.\r\n- feel valued, rewarded, and recognised.\r\n- know they are respected, physically and psychologically safe, included, and heard.\r\n- be able to get on with work at hand without barriers to efficiency.\r\n\r\nWe wish to create values that articulate the beliefs and summary behaviours that take the City Corporation where it wants to go and a culture map that will support the organisation to do so and that includes all areas within our organisation. Values will provide the foundational elements needed to develop our culture and empower employees to work towards achieving our mission and Corporate Plan outcomes. \r\nThis work will also include the active engagement and application of these values for our Elected Members. The programme will include engagement that takes into account the diverse voices of our staff workforce of nearly 4,000 supporting a wide range of services and responsibilities, located within and outside the Square Mile, as well as our institutions and our elected Member community of 125.",

The power to make Direct Payments to people with parental responsibility for disabled children and to disabled 16 and 17-year-olds was created by the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000.\r\nIf the Local Authority assesses a child or young person requires support to meet identified needs, these needs will be identified on a plan along with an identification of the services that can meet these needs.\r\nIf families do not want to use services directly provided or commissioned by the Authority, they have the option of receiving the support by Direct Payments instead.\r\nA Direct Payment affords a family the flexibility to look beyond &#039;off-the-peg&#039; service solutions provided by the Authority and choose from a range of alternative employment, education and leisure activities to meet their child&#039;s assessed needs. In many cases, the Direct Payment is used to employ a personal assistant to enable a child to access these activities.\r\n",

Underwater noise is increasing in the marine environment. A key area of concern is impulsive noise which can be generated from a range of activities including piling during the installation of offshore wind turbine foundations. Without mitigation, mid-frequency sound, such as from impact piling, has been shown to cause permanent hearing loss, tissue damage and lethal injury to marine mammals. The sound can also result in disturbance effects, such as disruption of foraging and potential impacts to breeding, communication and navigation. This can be potentially more harmful at the population level as it can impact a larger number of marine mammals. Fish have also been shown to have lethal and sub-lethal effects from impulsive sounds. It is thought that piling can also cause physiological impacts to eggs and larvae as these life stages contain air sacs. Other impacts such as poor body condition post hatching could occur, in addition to behavioural impacts that can affect the population level. For example, if piling activity is to take place close to a known spawning bed or ground for herring during the key spawning period, the behaviour of the spawning herring could potentially be disturbed, leading to spawning taking place in less suitable locations, or not at all. Mackerel have demonstrated changes in their shoaling behaviour when exposed to piling noise and Atlantic cod have been shown to have delayed migrations to spawning grounds when exposed to pile driving noise.",

                "description": "&quot;Grimsargh Skew Bridge is a single span reinforced concrete structure which was previously strengthened in 2001. Currently, the width of the main bridge restricts traffic to a single lane width, restricting flow of vehicles. There are steel pedestrian footbridges on both sides (east &amp; west) of the bridge. The eastern footbridge is relatively new and will be retained. A scheme has been developed to widen the structure to enable two-way traffic for vehicles and therefore improve traffic flows. The works substantially consist of the demolition of the western footbridge, the widening of the existing main bridge and the installation of a signalised pedestrian crossing to the north of the bridge, adjacent to the nearby primary school. \r\n\r\nThe design of both the temporary and permanent works required for the bridge widening is proposed to be designed by the contractor to match the fixed highways alignment designed by LCC. \r\n\r\nThe full scope of this project is contained at ITT Appendix 5 and the associated contractual documents. Please ensure that you read all documentation in the preparation of your Tender and should you have any queries on the contents, please raise a clarification request in the manner described at paragraph 2.7 within the timescales outlined with paragraph 3.1.&quot;",

For this reason, an Independent Mental Health Act Advocate (IMHA) service is provided to patients of the ELFT Forensic Service by The Advocacy Project, which is commissioned by London Borough of Hackney. If a service user has been assessed as having a lack of mental capacity in relation to making a specific decision about their lives, a best interests decision is made under the Mental Capacity Act and this is supported by an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate, as required within the Mental Capacity Act (2015), which is also provided by The Advocacy Project. Finally, Care Act Advocacy is provided by The Advocacy Project in relation to the Care Act (2014). \r\nAdditional advocacy can be provided outside the above legal frameworks. This can be provided to all service users, whether or not the above legislation applies to them. Additional advocacy can be provided by a paid advocate or volunteer. Many providers of statutory advocacy are able to offer additional advocacy and have the relevant skills and experience to do so effectively.\r\nAdditional advocacy can be provided either on an individual or group basis, in order to support service users in being able to speak up for themselves. This could support longer-term advocacy support and help service users in speaking out in meetings, accompanied if needed, and writing letters to raise concerns and complaints.\r\nEast London NHS Foundation Trust wishes to sub-contract a provider to provide an additional Advocacy Service for the Forensic Directorate.",

The Care Suite model in Sheffield is an evolution on the current offer of Extra Care, Residential Care and Nursing Care provision.\r\n We are asking care and support providers across all spectrums and registered housing providers to consider the design, build and delivery of Care Suites in Sheffield. \r\nThe Care Suite model development has been given approval by Adult Health and Social Care Policy Committee on the 30/10/2024 to proceed to the next stage of the programme. We want to involve you in our thinking. \r\nWe are holding two market engagement events in January. The first will be an online event on the 21st January 2025 at 10am till 11:30am. If you would like to attend this event please email adam.elwis@sheffield.gov.uk and I will make sure you receive a Teams invitation. \r\nThe second will be a face to face meeting on the 30th January 2025 9:30am till 12pm at a venue to be announced.

Surveys are required to be undertaken when coastal vegetation is at its minima, average and maxima (c. January, March/April and June). The proposed work will include three LiDAR surveys, each with accompanying ground truth surveys, collected with a GNSS receiver rover (short occupation only, no tripod required). Accuracy requirements for ground truthing measurements are to be within Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) &#xB1;3cm horizontal and &#xB1;4cm vertical, equivalent to a detailed survey performed under relative kinematic methodology as per RICS &#039;Use of GNSS in land surveying and mapping 3rd edition&#039; standards.

The purpose of this market consultation is to ascertain the interest of any qualified providers and to understand what services are available in the current market.  Completion of the questionnaire and any involvement in the market engagement exercise does not confer any right or expectation that a supplier will be selected for any contract should a procurement exercise be undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe Planning Policy and Environment team at Wakefield Council is responsible for authoring and consulting on a range of policies and guidance documents. These include the statutory development plan for the district (the Local Plan) as well as Supplementary Planning Documents (SPD), Design Codes and Conservation Area Appraisals. To undertake this work effectively, the council needs a system which allows collaborative authoring (more than one officer can amend the documents simultaneously) as well as enabling stakeholders to comment on individual sections of the document. This enables effective analysis by each document section.  It is also important for the system to contain a mailing list of interested parties, enable interested parties to register via the website and enable notifications of consultation events to be sent to such parties. Interested parties would have an account within the software for them to draft comments and eventually submit them to the consultation. Once submitted, the system would need to be able to display comments on the website next to the relevant section of the draft policy document.",

We invite you to complete our EOI if you believe your organisation can also make a positive difference to the lives of people in your local community through helping them into sustainable work.\r\n\r\nOpportunity Overview\r\nConnect to Work is part of the Government&#039;s Get Britain Working Strategy. The programme will be commissioned locally by lead accountable bodies (e.g. Combined Authorities and Local Authorities). Connect to Work is a voluntary, high-fidelity Supported Employment programme in England and Wales, to help economically inactive people who want to work, to remove their barriers to work and find sustainable employment. Priority participants groups will be disabled people, people with health conditions and people in the specified cohorts. The specified cohorts are: Offenders or ex-offenders; carers or ex-carers; people who are homeless; a former member of the Armed Forces or partner of current/former Armed Forces personnel; a person with a drug/alcohol dependency; a care experienced young person or care leaver; a refugee, a resettled Afghan or a person on the Ukrainian scheme; a victim/survivor of domestic abuse; young persons identified as being involved/at risk of being involved in serious violence; victims of modern slavery.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that 75% of participants will follow the Individual Placement &amp; Support (IPS) model and 25% will follow the Supported Employment model. It is expected that delivery partners will follow the respective fidelity assurance systems (IPS and SEQF).\r\n\r\nWe are seeking expressions of interest (EOI) from local organisations with experience of locally delivering: \r\n1. IPS services\r\n2. Supported Employment services\r\n3. Proven employability services, supporting those who are furthest from the labour market\r\n4. Specialist services removing barriers to employment for one or more of the above specified groups\r\nGiven that the nature of these locally commissioned programmes will require local, community-based delivery, we will be looking for evidence of this in EOI responses.\r\n\r\nResponding to this EOI\r\nPlease fully complete and submit this EOI before the closing date of Friday 10th January 2025 at 6pm.  The EOI can be found here: https://forms.office.com/e/3qNDcNPRMG \r\n\r\nContact partner.network@reed.com should you have questions. For information on how we score our EOIs and work with partners, visit our website https://reedinpartnership.co.uk/partners/ \r\n\r\nPlease note, this does not constitute an offer to work with your organisation, but is the first stage in our selection process. For organisations successful at EOI stage, we will undertake further due diligence and commercial pricing analysis to make our final selection of partners. Thank you for your interest in working with us.",

This will support one of WWF UK&#039;s key results under its current strategy period; to address drivers of biodiversity loss and &#039;ensure we are on track for populations of our priority species in our priority places to be stable or increasing by 2030&#039;.\r\nAsia&#039;s pangolins continue to be threatened by demand for their scales, used in traditional medicine, and for their meat consumed as a luxury dish. Despite being listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), regulation of trafficking across international borders remains a problem. A lack of information regarding the trade routes used, and inadequate use of the available legal tools to deter trafficking, are thought to be key obstacles to countering this crime.

In Dudley this service is often referred to by families as a Staycation. \r\n      \r\n      The Council will evaluate the award of the Agreement on the basis of the most economically advantageous Tender and reserves the right to make contract awards to no more than 3 successful Tenderers, this will form a framework, where referrals will be shared by Dudley to the providers, and the best fit will be sourced for the child/young person requiring the staycation. The Council reserves the right, subject to relevant legislation, at any time to reject any Tender.\r\n      \r\n      All disabled children are considered to be a child &#039;in need&#039; (see section 17 of the Children Act 1989) and therefore the Local Authority has a general duty to safeguard and promote their welfare by providing a range and level of services appropriate to their needs. If a disabled child or their parent requests an assessment then there is a duty to assess in each case, including any needs for carer support.\r\n      \r\n      The Children Act 1989 and the Breaks for Carers of Disabled Children Regulations 2011 require local authorities to provide services designed to give breaks for carers of children with disabilities. The break should enhance the ability of parent carers to care for their disabled child and any other children they may have.\r\n      \r\n      Short break provision must have regard to the needs of carers who would be unable to continue to provide care unless breaks from caring were given to them, as well as the needs of those carers who would be able to provide care more effectively if breaks from caring allowed them to undertake education and training, leisure activities or carry out day to day tasks. \r\n      \r\n      In meeting our duties to promote the welfare and safeguard children and young people, we also want to ensure that our short breaks offer, helps to support a child or young person&#039;s social and emotional development as well as providing them with new experiences and an opportunity to learn new skills. It is important that the short break gives the young person the opportunity to develop their independence in preparation for adulthood.\r\n      Overnight short breaks can be provided by local authorities under:\r\n      o section 17(6) of the 1989 Act, which grants local authorities a power to provide accommodation as part of a range of services in order to discharge their general duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in need; and\r\n      o section 20(4) of the 1989 Act, which grants local authorities a power to provide accommodation &#039;for any child within their area (even though a person who has parental responsibility for him/her is able to provide him/her with accommodation) if they consider that to do so would safeguard or promote the child&#039;s welfare&#039;.",

All levels will be expected to be accessible to all service users:\r\n\r\nInformation (Level One) - An information service gives clients the information they need, for them to know and do more about their situation. It can include signposting, providing factual information about the role of another organisation, and/or how to find or contact that organisation. Responsibility for taking any further action rests with the client.\r\n\r\nAdvice (Level Two) - An advice service involves: a diagnosis of the client&amp;apos;s enquiry and the issues involved, giving information and explaining options, identifying further action the client can take, and some assistance: e.g. contacting third parties to seek information; filling in forms. This would usually be completed with one interview although there may be some follow-up work. The client would take responsibility for any further action.\r\n\r\nAdvice with Casework (Level Three) - Some advice with casework service includes all the elements of an advice service previously listed and also involves taking action on behalf of the client to move the case on. It could include negotiating on behalf of the client with third parties on the telephone, by letter or face-to-face. It will usually involve follow-up work and the adviser would take responsibility for this.\r\n\r\nWe&amp;apos;re currently anticipating a contract term of five and a half years and a two two-year allowable extensions (5.5 + 2 + 2).  ",

As such the Company has fixed the rates that agency providers are required to pay to their staff (as a minimum rate of pay) and has hence fixed the rates it will pay agencies for the provision of services under this tender. The proposed rates (being the current rates of pay and chargeable rates) are set out in Appendix 2 along with the mechanism for uplifting annually in line with increases to the National Living Wage and the Real Living Wage. Untrained workers (see criteria for trained workers below) and trained workers must be paid the National Living Wage or Real Living Wage irrespective of age and the chargeable rates for such untrained workers are also set out in Appendix 2 along with the future pricing mechanism. For clarity if the contract is extended the pricing mechanism shall continue as per the initial two years.\r\n\r\nThis tender is therefore quality and sustainability focused as prices payable are fixed.",

We are seeking support from companies and partners that can provide individual or a range of the services identified below.\r\n      \r\n      Whilst these will predominantly be for the purposes of our new homes development, there are often cases of individual existing homes where we need specialist support and advice. Whether this be in relation to defects, disrepair or structural matters, concerns raised by customers or Bromford seeking to dispose of the home, we need a range of partners that can support these elements as well.\r\n      \r\n      Organisations can be added to the DPS at anytime throughout the year, once they have completed the qualifying process (first stage). The organisation will then form part of Bromfords&#039; approved list and can bid for tenders.\r\n      \r\n      The statements below are not an exhaustive list of requirements that will be appointed, but designed to give an overview of the services required. Each appointment will be subject to a scope of works specific to each project.\r\n      \r\n      Bromford needs to appoint the following services:-\r\n      Clerks of Work\r\n      Employers Agent\r\n      Party Wall Surveyor\r\n      Ecologist\r\n      Highways/Transport Planner\r\n      Archaeologist\r\n      Acoustic Consultant\r\n      Ground Investigation\r\n      Landscape Architect\r\n      Construction Health and Safety Services\r\n      Energy Consultant Services (Gas, Electric, Water)\r\n      Planning Consultant\r\n      SAP Assessor\r\n      Adoption Consultant\r\n      Property/Land Valuer\r\n      Valuations\r\n      Civil Engineer\r\n      Structural Engineer\r\n      Auctioneers\r\n      Surveying Services\r\n      \r\n      Due to Bromford increasing in size and covering multiple areas across England, we would require the DPS to have 2 Lots per service. This would cover the North localities and the South regions separately. The bidders can apply to one or both locality areas if they have experience in these areas.\r\n      \r\n      Bromford class the North locality regions as: Staffordshire and the Marches, Newcastle under Lyme, Stoke on Trent, Stafford, Telford and Wrekin, Cannock, Shropshire, Bromsgrove, Lichfield, Redditch, Wolverhampton, Walsall, Dudley, Sandwell, Birmingham, Solihull, Coventry, North Warwickshire, South Derbyshire, Warwick, Rugby, Daventry and surrounding areas.\r\n      \r\n      Bromford class the South locality regions as: Tewkesbury, Malvern Hills, Worcestershire, Stratford Upon Avon, Cheltenham, Herefordshire, Forest of Dean, Stroud, Cotswolds, South Gloucestershire, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Bedford, South Northamptonshire, Milton Keynes, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Swindon, Bristol, Bath, North/East Somerset and surrounding areas.",

                "description": "Located on the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire, Diamond Light Source (DLS) is a leading-edge facility for science, engineering and innovation. Diamond allows researchers from academia and industry to investigate the structure and behaviour of the world around us at the atomic and molecular level.\r\n\r\nTo continue delivering the world changing science that Diamond enables, the facility is being upgraded to Diamond-II, a coordinated programme of development that combines a major machine upgrade with new instruments and complementary improvements to optics,detectors, sample environment and delivery capabilities, and computing, as well as integrated and correlative methods. This will be transformative in speed and spatial resolution and will offer users streamlined access to enhanced instruments for life and physical sciences.\r\n\r\nThe logistics model devised that underpins this programme mandates a suitable offsite storage facility to be secured for a period of three years starting sometime during 2025. This will serve as a cross-dock style operation with inbound material being checked, identified and prepared for despatch to the point of installation in the synchrotron and surrounding buildings in a timely fashion. The material consists of technical equipment delivered from around the world normally in wooden crates or pallets. \r\n\r\nThe requirement is for Warehouse space up to 3750 sq. metres, no less than 1350 sq. metres.  This pace need not be contiguous and can be spread across up to five different sites.\r\nThere may also be a kitting process established. An estimated 20% of the footprint will be racking and shelving. The remaining open floor area will be used for marshalling the inbound inventory and setting out for inspection and despatch.\r\n\r\nTo apply visit our website which requires suppliers to complete a one-off simple registration form, which will generate a unique password for your account.  You are then able to login to register your interest against the Tender and download the tender documents.\r\n\r\nLink to the site:  https://tenders.diamond.ac.uk/Home.aspx",

Communities across West Yorkshire and York are seeing the benefits of new, high-quality cycling and walking infrastructure, including Bradford&#039;s Canal Road Cycleway, Leeds&#039;s City Centre Cycle Superhighway, the Castleford Wakefield Greenway, a series of canal towpath upgrades in Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale, and Scarborough Bridge, York.  \r\n\r\nThe team delivers a series of awareness campaigns and engagement initiatives, including support for businesses, schools and other grassroots projects to boost the number of people travelling actively. Alongside these campaigns, the team funds free of charge adult cycle training across the 5 districts which has resulted in over 6,000 people learn to ride with confidence and make the shift to incorporate cycling into their daily lives. \r\n\r\nIn 2022, &#xA3;830 million of City Regions Sustainable Travel Settlement (CRSTS) funding was secured from government to make it easier for people to walk, cycle and use public transport over the next five years. This investment has been made possible thanks to the Mayoral devolution deal, and CRSTS will build on other transport infrastructure programmes such as the Transforming Cities Fund, West Yorkshire Plus Transport Fund and the Leeds Public Transport Investment Programme.\r\n\r\nWe are looking to commission an external organisation to engage with local communities to promote active and sustainable travel through a rewards-based platform. The successful delivery organisation should be able to offer an off the shelf app-based platform which works for all mobile operating systems, which can successfully track journeys made by a user and offer rewards for travelling on foot, by bike or on public transport. Rewards offered should be localised as much as possible within West Yorkshire and suppliers should aim to promote local business growth. Rewards should be relevant to the audience and should promote reasonable changes in travel behaviour.",

The service aims to:\r\n•\tImprove overall health outcomes by providing better access to healthcare and support services for vulnerable people\r\n•\tReduce reoffending by addressing the underlying factors contributing to offending behaviour.\r\nThe provider will deliver the L&amp;D service in all London custody suites, Magistrates&#039; Courts, Crown Courts and will include a dedicated Community Team of community link workers and peer support workers. It will also deliver a service for individuals who are dealt with by Voluntary Attendance/Interview who have vulnerabilities. It will share appropriate information with Criminal Justice System partners (police, Judiciary, Crown Prosecution Service, Probation etc) as well as supporting individuals into appropriate health and other services.\r\n\r\nMental Health Treatment Requirements for Men only\r\nThe provider will deliver in London MHTR treatment service for men only where the Courts deem it would be appropriate to include a MHTR as part of a Community Sentence. The service would screen men who had been referred by either Probation, Defence or Liaison and Diversion who are potentially suitable for a MHTR. If the individual agrees, this will be shared with Probation who will include the recommendation into the Pre Sentence Report for the Judiciary for them to consider whether a MHTR could be part of any sentencing options. Where a man is given a MHTR as part of a community order the provider would deliver a number of sessions over a specified period, determined by the court and provide psychological treatment/interventions, to address the underlying mental health issues which may be contributing towards the underlying offending issues. The Service will work directly with probation around support which will increase compliance, as well as proactively support the man to comply with the MHTR, and therefore reduce breaches. This service would be available to any man appearing in any of the Magistrates&#039; Courts or Crown Courts in London.\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEE THE &#039;ATTACHMENTS&#039; SECTION FOR THE FULL ADVERT.",

As part of this review we are approaching other local authorities and local kennels to determine what options are available.\r\n      \r\n      Both Councils have officers in place to collect stray dogs that are either found by residents or temporarily dropped off at local vets, but we need a kennel facility to take them to where they can be looked after until our officers can re-home them or get them to a rescue centre. Legally we need to keep dogs for a minimum period of 7 days, during which period we hope the registered keeper will claim the dog. \r\n      \r\n      Full arrangements would obviously need to be discussed further but we are looking to see if this is something you are able to even consider when assessing the key criteria and requirements listed below;\r\n      \r\n      •We currently have access to 5 kennels (3 for TRDC and 2 for Watford).\r\n      •Officers would need to be able to access the kennels between the hours of 10am to 6pm (possibly up to 7pm, but this can be discussed further) either via your staff being available to let them in, or being provided with their own access.\r\n      •We cannot guarantee the dogs coming in will be vaccinated or not have fleas and/or other medical conditions - and therefore consideration needs to be made about if there is a possibility of the kennels for our dogs being separate from any boarding dogs (we will however commit to seek veterinary assistance if any ailment is obvious upon collection or if this apparent once in the kennels).\r\n      •The care the dogs would need is 2 x exercise per day, except where it&#039;s not safe to do so, and obviously fed etc.  \r\n      \r\n      We would be very grateful if you could submit your interest through either submitting some Company information into the Tenderbox associated with this notice or dropping an email to us.

                "description": "The Castle Eden Dene NNR team has a requirement for a small heavy duty contractor flail collector for use on its suite of reserves, to help with the effective management of grassland restoration projects on grassland SSSI.\r\nIdeally the mower will be suitable for use with a compact tractor and have the option of wheels to support the unit whilst cutting. Note: there is a requirement for the machine to be able to cut vegetation at a height of around 300mm, hence the need for supporting wheels (the mower will only be operated at 300mm when used for cutting the seedheads of invasive tall grasses or when topping thistles), this is to avoid damaging the sensitive herb layer.\r\n\r\nThe mower will primarily be used for sensitive grassland works in the summer months to control invasives, however in the winter we will require it to remove gorse and other woody stems, as well as general grass cutting where grazing intervention is not possible.\r\n\r\nWheels or similar are desirable, to allow for elevated cutting and supporting the machine when cutting on uneven ground (to prevent bouncing). Note both wheel design and weight of machine may also be taken into consideration when awarding the contract as the grasslands are sensitive and rutting of sensitive grassland needs to be kept to a minimum.\r\n\r\nThe required minimum specification for the machinery is as follows: \r\n•\tFront feeder plate - assists with intake of tall material.\r\n•\tWheeled height adjustable - to enable a cutting height of around 300mm.\r\n•\tHi-tip ability for loading material into trailers. \r\n•\tSafeguards to reducing the risk of damaging the machine from hitting unknown and unseen obstacles.\r\n•\tSuitable cutting heads for work detailed above.\r\n•\tGearbox with overrun clutch to avoid damage to gearbox or tractor.\r\n•\tThree-point linkage mounted.\r\n•\tHD rotor bearings to withstand shock loads to the rotor in tough environments.\r\n•\tHD Side Skids to help follow the ground and reduce damage to the machine\r\n•\tAppropriate documentation would be expected with all kit, as well as a good level of warranty period. Options for servicing packages would also be required.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally: information you will need to detail/ supply will include:\r\n•\tMin Tractor HP required to operate\r\n•\tMachine weight\r\n•\tMinimum lift needed to operate\r\n•\tCutting width\r\n•\tCarrying capacity of cut material\r\n\r\n\r\nTo apply for this opportunity you must submit your quotation meeting the requirements detailed in the Request for Quotation (RFQ) attached.\r\nYour response must be sent to joe.davies@naturalengland.org.uk\t\t\t\t\t\r\n by 5pm on 10/01/2025.\r\n\r\nIf you have any clarification questions linked to this opportunity or the procurement process please submit these via email to joe.davies@naturalengland.org.uk. Please note that, unless commercially sensitive, both the question and the response will be circulated to all tenderers.",

The goal is to provide comprehensive pathways that cater to various user needs, whether they are seeking grant eligibility, researching technologies, impartial property assessments, or trusted installers of specific low carbon technologies (LCTs).\r\nGMCA is seeking a supplier to redevelop our existing Portal to:\r\n-\tEnhance the user interface and experience.\r\n-\tProvide clear and accessible pathways for all users, including administrators of the portal.\r\n-\tIntegrate new offerings for LCTs, which will be developed and delivered through procured suppliers.\r\n-\tCreate a flexible infrastructure to easily build in new, emerging grant schemes, such as the devolved delivery of Warm Homes Social Housing Fund and Local Grant, and changes to existing grant scheme eligibility requirements. \r\n-\tAllow users the option to easily integrate their own Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems with the portal using APIs and a data export functionality, to reduce duplication of work, and make it easier to track, share and collect data.\r\n-\tInclude the functionality to evaluate performance post retrofit installation\r\nWe expect that the grant scheme criteria, pathways and new offerings for LCTs will reflect a dynamic process. Through our current delivery using the Portal we are constantly making small improvements to the customer journey and expect that this will carry on once the initial redevelopment phase has been completed and we are delivering through the devolution funding. We would like the redevelopment to allow updates and changes to the Portal to be made quickly and easily and are open to an overhaul compared to the original purpose for the way the Portal was built (specifically delivery of the ECO4 LA Flex grant scheme). \r\nThe portal redevelopment, aiming to improve visibility and access to specific technologies, is envisaged to be centred around changes to the landing page, giving three options to &quot;Check for everything&quot;, &quot;I want an impartial property options assessment&quot; or &quot;I know what I want&quot;, from which the new offerings would span from. \r\n\r\nFull documents are available to download via the Chest: https://www.the-chest.org.uk/",

                "description": "Background:\r\nThe Hinkley BEEMS (British EDF Estuarine and Marine Studies) programme is funded by New Nuclear Build Generation Company (HPC) Ltd. Through this programme, Cefas provide authoritative scientific information on the marine and transitional waters in the vicinity of potential new build nuclear power stations and require a competent supplier to deliver the element described below.\r\n\r\nRequirement:\r\nBathymetric surveys in the Severn Estuary are required to be completed during the construction phase of the Hinkley Point C (HPC) build programme. A total of two surveys are required in 2025.\r\n\r\nThe supplier will undertake two multibeam echo sounder (MBES) bathymetric surveys. The first survey is expected between January to March 2025 which will serve as a pre-disposal for the placement of dredged material survey at the Portishead dredge disposal site (LU070) and King Road and Avonmouth Harbour Approaches area in the Severn Estuary, Somerset (see Figure 1). The second survey will be completed within two months of completion of initial capital dredge works (estimated September / October 2025).\r\n\r\nThe bathymetric survey area covers the entire Kings Road and Avonmouth Approaches area, which encompasses the dredge disposal site LU070 (Portishead). With regard to the Portishead disposal site, data is officially required for the disposal area plus a 100m buffer of the Northern, Eastern, and Southern boundary and a 250m buffer on the Western boundary (Figure 1). Figure 1 shows that the Southern &#039;buffer&#039; boundary runs parallel with the edge of the Southern boundary of the wider Kings Road and Avonmouth Approaches area. This Southern boundary skirts the intertidal zone but it is important to gather data here if safe to do so. Table 1 gives the bounding coordinates for the Kings Road and Avonmouth Approaches Area.\r\nGiven the presence of fluid mud in the area (causing false bed heights during low energy periods), and the proximity of the Southern boundary to the intertidal zone, the survey must be undertaken during a period of Spring tides.\r\n\r\nAs the two survey datasets will be directly compared with each other, and used for volumetric analysis, suppliers who commit the same vessel to both surveys would be more favourable.\r\nCefas require the vessel(s), vessel crew, hydrographic survey team, and suitable equipment to undertake the surveys described. Cefas also require a lead hydrographic surveyor, with at least 5 years industry experience, to be present on the vessel(s) for the duration of each of the above surveys. Suppliers should also be aware that a client representative may join for part, or all, of the surveys. This will be confirmed within the pre-survey meeting.\r\nFor full details download the Bidder Pack at https://defra-family.force.com/s/Welcome and search for CEFAS24-144 under opportunities.",

The Ministry of Justice wishes to guarantee the safe and efficient transfer of services with minimal disruption to staff and prisoners, whilst ensuring the prison is modernised to enable it to be fit for the future.\r\n\r\nDetails of the procurement can be found in the Invitation to Tender (ITT) documents which are structured into five volumes and are located in Ministry of Justice&#039;s e-Sourcing Portal (Jaggaer).\r\n\r\nVolume 1: Introduction, Instructions, Procurement Process and indicative timelines - providing instructions on the completion and submission of tenders.\r\nVolume 2: Bidder Response Criteria - providing details of the Response Criteria Bidders are required to cover in their Bids, together with guidance on completion of Bidder responses against each criterion.\r\nVolume 3: The Draft Contract.\r\nVolume 4: Evaluation Methodology - providing details of the evaluation methodology by which the Bid will be evaluated and the award criteria; and\r\nVolume 5: Data Rooms - containing details of the data and information that the Authority is making available to Bidders to assist them in the preparation of their Tenders.",

The courses are open to adults who are full-time and part-time employed, unemployed or returning to work after a break or self-employed, to address the needs of employers and the wider economy, to deliver targeted interventions to meet short/medium term demand to fill vacancies and drive productivity. \r\n\r\nFor more on the national programme and skills bootcamps go to https://find-employer-schemes.education.gov.uk/ \r\n\r\nWe are inviting organisations to apply to join the APL to deliver skills bootcamps in Buckinghamshire across the following Lots: Lot 1 Digital, Lot 2 Construction, Lot 3 Green Skills, Lot 4 Engineering (e.g. Motor Vehicle Technician), Lot 5 Creative, Lot 6 Business &amp; Administration, Lot 7 Hospitality &amp;Tourism, Lot 8 - Education &amp; Early Years \r\n\r\nThese interventions will help to support the upskilling of individuals between Level 2 to Level 3 with qualifications relevant to the sector and the job. \r\n\r\nThe APL will be in place for 3 years. It is anticipated that call-off contracts will be conducted annually from the list either by direct award or mini-competition. Similarly to allocate any additional funds. It is anticipated call-off contracts will commence April 2025. \r\n\r\nThe estimated value of call-off contracts is &#xA3;10,500,000 over 3 years subject to funding, based on the Council&#039;s application for 2025-26 from the Department for Education to support learners through Skills Bootcamps. Contracts awarded will be subject to available budget and resource. \r\n\r\nThe APL is being established under the Public Contract Regulation 2015 Light Touch Regime.\r\n\r\nOrganisations wishing to apply to join the APL for Skills Bootcamps Lot(s) are requested to register on the Councils portal www.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk, express and interest in this procurement, download and return completed in full the relevant documentation (guidance, specifications, contract terms and conditions, and response document questionnaires) which is available for download.

                "description": "Central Bedfordshire Council is planning to increase the number of property disposals as part of a strategic approach to modernising the property portfolio through reinvestment in more modern, warmer and energy efficient homes. The Housing Service requires a professional &#039;Estate Agency&#039; service to help sell the required properties. The plan is to dispose of between 30 to 60 properties\r\n      each year, although this could increase. To demonstrate the potential value of the contract, a typical cost of 1% of the sales price, with an average of &#xA3;250,000/property, results in fees of &#xA3;2,500. For 30 disposals, the total value is &#xA3;75,000. \r\n      \r\n      We require the complete services of an estate agent to sell Council owned domestic properties. The service should include the following:\r\n      \r\n      • Valuation - we require the property to be visited within three working days of request, for a valuation of the property and an explanation of how the valuation was arrived at, including a best price guide. The valuation and other appropriate advice concerning the proposed sale, must be in writing to enable the Council to consider the sales approach. The visit will normally be accompanied with a Council Officer but may be unaccompanied using a key safe.\r\n      • Instruction - where the valuation is agreed/approved, the sale of the property will be confirmed through instruction.\r\n      • Selling - once instructed, we require the property to be advertised online via Rightmove, Zoopla, and everywhere else buyers look. We require that you host viewings on behalf of the Council, and that you always act professionally on behalf of the Council. We require you to take and consider offers made, putting offers to the Council along with advice and/or recommendations concerning the offer. Where appropriate, you should negotiate the best price (all with our approval).\r\n      \r\n      Please confirm your fee basis, i.e. whether you charge a percentage of the agreed sale price and if so, what percentage you charge. Alternatively, please confirm whether you charge a fixed fee for a completed property sale, and what that fee would be.",

This will cover the refurbishment of the existing gymnasium at the Sports Centre on the University campus.\r\n      \r\n      The works and services required are fully described in Section 2 of the ITT.     \r\n      \r\n      Section 2 of the ITT details the Introduction Document and also provides a copy of the Document Register of the Tender Specification Documents.\r\n      \r\n      The Tender Specification Documents are attached as separate documents.   \r\n      \r\n      All Tenderers will be required to submit a compliant tender response in accordance with the tender requirements as set out in the Tender Specification Documents. \r\n      \r\n      All tender responses will be subject to the Tender Evaluation Methodology as set out in the Invitation to Tender.\r\n      \r\n      Tenderers can consider and/or submit at their own discretion a response pertaining to any element of their proposal where value engineering can be achieved. Tenderers are required to note that any value engineering proposal will not be subject to the tender evaluation and will therefore not be scored.\r\n      \r\n      The University will reserve the discretion to accept and/or reject any variation to the tender requirement with the successful tenderer post tender.\r\n      \r\n      The estimated total value of the Contract for the Gymnasium Refurbishment Works is circa &#xA3;200,000 excluding VAT.\r\n      \r\n      The Gymnasium Refurbishment Works covering all of the works and services required to deliver the contract shall be completed by 20th June 2025.\r\n      \r\n      The Contract will commence on 24th February 2025 and will run until the completion date of 20th June 2025 followed by a 12-month defects liability period.\r\n      \r\n      Main reasons for decision not to subdivide contract into lots: Given the need for one main contractor to co-ordinate the delivery of the works and services required to deliver the project, the contract has not been subdivided into lots.\r\n      \r\n      In order to assist Tenderers in preparing their tender submission, the University will be holding a collective site visit with all potential Tenderers on Wednesday 18th December 2024 to allow Tenderers to see the working area in the Sports Centre, the access arrangements to same, the contractors areas on the all-weather pitch as well as a chance to review existing building services. \r\n      \r\n      It is a mandatory requirement that all Tenderers attend the site visit. Tenderers should note that the University is not in a position to offer any alternative dates.\r\n      \r\n      The site visit is not part of the scoring assessment and is offered to Tenderers by way of informing their Tender responses only.\r\n      \r\n      Further information on the site visit is provided in the Introduction Document in Section 2 of the ITT.",

Patients are required to be seen within 90 minutes of their booked appointment time. \r\n\r\nThe hubs are based in Purley War Memorial Hospital (south of the borough), Parkway Health Centre (New Addington, East of the borough) and a hub on site at Croydon Health Service NHS Trust (North of the borough) which allows for Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) colleagues to re-direct patients to a more appropriate setting. The service sees patients from any borough/ICB footprint and currently see around 4,800 patients per month. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the GP hubs is to provide a more appropriate setting for patients with an urgent, low-level acuity need. Conditions range from acute ear infection to minor injuries treated with gluing/suturing to minor trauma to hands, feet, or limb. This is in contrast to the other services within Integrated Urgent Care such as the UTC which will treat patients for more serious minor injuries for which treatment and investigations include; X-Ray, pathology, fracture clinic, CT, dressing of major wounds etc.\r\n\r\nThe tender will also require bidders to submit two financial bids for running both 3 and 4 hubs in order to inform decision making on affordability and value for money.\r\n\r\nPlease take into account the annual budget for this new contract is circa &#xA3;2.6m.\r\n\r\nContract will be for an initial 3 year period with the option to extend for a further two years.",

Since it opened, however, the buildings comprising the Barbican Centre have deteriorated significantly, and an ambitious and strategic programme of restoration, transformation and reactivation is needed. \r\n\r\nThe Wayfinding project will be delivered alongside a series of projects that will form the first phase of the Renewal programme, to be delivered between 2025 and 2030. This first phase of works will comprise significant upgrade, restoration and improvement works to the main Foyers, Lakeside, Conservatory and Sculpture Court and a programme of improvements to the Centre&#039;s central mechanical, electrical and plant (MEP) infrastructure systems. \r\n\r\nThe duration of the contract is 5 years, subject to the right of the City (at its sole discretion) to exercise its right to extend the Contract by up to 1 year. The maximum length of the contract is therefore 6 years.\r\n\r\nPlease view the Find a Tender service notice for full details.",

There are exceptions, which include the motorway within the City boundaries, and some major roads, which will remain the responsibility of the Cambridgeshire Police (CP), through its uniformed officers. A map of the current CEA is appended (Appendix 1).\r\nThe three other Districts within Cambridgeshire may be the subject of Applications by the County Council to the Secretary of State for CPE powers, and if this occurs during the life of this Contract, the other Districts may be brought into the scope of this contract. The Contractor will be involved throughout the process. The Contractor, in agreement with the Council, will provide additional Staff resources, including additional transport and accommodation dependent on any newly defined CEA. The contract is based on a Schedule of Rates, to enable the expansion of the contract to take place easily.\r\nThe contract term is an initial 5 years, with potential option to extend up to a further 5 years.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to predict the exact value of this contract as the Authority&#039;s requirements are likely to vary over the contract term, but it is estimated that the total value will not be less than &#xA3;10m if the contract runs for its full term of 10 years, or greater than &#xA3;12m. \r\n\r\nThe stated upper value of &#xA3;12m is by no means guaranteed, and only represents the headroom we need to allow should additional public bodies within Cambridgeshire wish to use this contract. Bidders are strongly advised to concentrate on the lower end of the stated range of value\r\n\r\nThe Authority have invested in an e-tendering tool in order to facilitate its tendering processes in a compliant and transparent manner.\r\n\r\nPotential Providers will need to register an account via the &quot;Procontract Portal&quot; at https://procontract.due-north.com/Register before being able to view the full tender details.\r\n\r\nIn order to access the tender documentation, click &quot;Find Opportunities&quot;, then on the drop-down menu, filter by &quot;Cambridgeshire Public Services&quot; by clicking on &quot;Update&quot; to find the relevant opportunity or alternatively within the organisations drop down select Cambridgeshire County Council to also find the relevant opportunity.\r\n\r\n",

                "title": "Untold Stories - a media literacy response to mis &amp; dis information",
                "description": "Under the Online Safety Act, Ofcom has media literacy duties including a responsibility to commission activities that support women and girls, help people spot and avoid misinformation, and understand how platforms use our personal data. This ITT sets out our requirements to help people spot and avoid mis and disinformation through understanding how stories become news. This will build their media literacy knowledge, skills and behaviour and their engagement with news.\r\n\r\nMedia literacy has a role to play in supporting people to possess the critical thinking skills to better spot mis and disinformation and identify news and information they can trust. literacy, sometimes known as news literacy, teaches audiences how to judge the reliability and credibility of news and information, and distinguish professionally produced news from other forms of content. Our research showing that 44% of people agreed with the statement &quot;the more a story is edited, the less it is likely to be true&quot; suggests that enhancing understanding of how stories become news could better equip people to make more informed judgements about mis and disinformation.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, local media has a vital role to play in the social fabric of the UK. Local media, and particularly the local public interest news it produces, can help to deliver important benefits to society by supporting local democracy and holding councils and other local institutions to account. Local media is also an important way for many communities to stay informed about local information and events, which in turn can help to promote social cohesion and community engagement. It can give a voice to people from a variety of backgrounds and beliefs, reflect an entire community back to itself and promote greater mutual understanding. It also has the potential to stimulate local economies by promoting local businesses and events that bring people into an area. As a result, effective local media provision has previously been described as an important element of the glue that can help build and bind communities together. Research also points to the commitment of local journalists to create a sense of community and to defend it, suggesting that engagement with local media could be part of the solution to countering wider hatred, disinformation and polarisation.\r\n\r\nWe require an organisation or organisations who can deliver a programme that improves adults&#039; media literacy skills, specifically that they are better able to identify mis and disinformation and that they have a better understanding of how news is produced, ideally through having produced their own local news reports. It is likely that your organisation has already developed a media/news literacy programme, although it may require some adaptation to meet the requirements of this tender.",

This is part of a suite of work being prepared during the Development Phase of a National Lottery Heritage Fund project which will culminate in a 2nd Round (Delivery Phase) application submission in October 2025.\r\n\r\nSt Margaret&#039;s in Ruins Conservation Trust is a registered charity (CIO) run by volunteers. The trust manages a unique site, the ruins of St Margaret&#039;s Church and Churchyard, in West Raynham, Norfolk, under a 25-year lease. \r\n\r\nSt Margaret&#039;s dates back to Norman times and was an active church for several centuries. It fell into disrepair in the 18th century and was largely abandoned. The ruined church is Grade II Listed  and in 2023 it was included in Historic England&#039;s Heritage at Risk Register and given Category A Status, due to concerns about potential catastrophic collapse.\r\n\r\nThe primary requirement of this brief is to establish the scope of work required to stabilise the ruins for the long-term. \r\n\r\nFor all enquiries and tender submissions please contact SMIRCT at  info@st-margarets-ruins.org",

The service will provide &#039;settling in&#039; once the person returns home and connect with other voluntary sector / statutory services if ongoing support identified through the strength based approach.  Strengths and asset-based approaches focus on what individuals and communities have and how they can work together, rather than on what individuals don&#039;t have or can&#039;t do. Citizens using the service should be identified as Pathway 0 (P0) or Pathway 1 (P1) and able to stand and transfer from chair to chair with minimal support. \r\n\r\nThrough provision of a low level &#039;settling in&#039;, citizens will be supported in their first few hours when they return.  They may have been admitted to hospital in crisis and been away from their home for a number of weeks, meaning that support to get the heating on, food in and provide low level support to settle at home and connect them to onward services will provide a safety net at point of discharge.  This is to reduce the risk of readmission for vulnerable patients who may not require care, but live alone and require increased low level support at point of return to their home. \r\n\r\nThe service will deliver the ambition to support people to be discharged to the right place, at the right time and with the right support that maximised their independence and leads to the best possible sustainable outcome.  This is outlined in the Hospital discharge and community support guidance - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).\r\n\r\nTo register your interest, please follow the link below, and search for the project reference as detailed: https://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome\r\n\r\nProject Reference: C323149\r\n\r\nProject Name: 1862 Transfer and Settle Service for NHS Derby and Derbyshire ICB",

The project aims to assess the type and quantity of a wide range of contaminants that may be introduced to soils and groundwater by the spread of biosolids.

(If providing activities of more than 2 hours a week to children under 8, this must be registered with OFSTED)\r\n\r\nLot 1b: Individual Activity\r\n1:1 day or evening community-based activity for children and young people aged 0-18th birthday, which can include accessing evening activities such as youth groups, weekend activities and school holiday clubs as well as `buddying` and support of individual interests. \r\n\r\nLot 2: Family Support at Home \r\nFor children and young people up to their 18th birthday (which requires registration with Care Quality Commission).\r\nProviders are encouraged to deliver short breaks at home to disabled children during the day and may also provide care and support overnight where this would provide a break to the family from undertaking caring activities. Short breaks activities at home are for children and young persons who have complex assessed needs that may prevent them from accessing short break activities in the community. For avoidance of doubt this is a short break offer that provides respite to the parent/carer and not traditional home care. As such this will not be commissioned solely to provide personal care or take a child to school. The emphasis of this support is on respite and positive activities to promote outcomes for children and young people.  Staff are expected to be skilled and to have experience in line with the short breaks&#039; agenda.  \r\n\r\nThe Accreditation List duration will be for five years with two possible extension periods of two years each. at the Authority&#039;s discretion.\r\n \r\nThe Accreditation List value is estimated to be &#xA3;1.8 million over the total length of the duration (including any extensions).\r\n\r\nThe Authority will buy services from the Accreditation List Providers using a Call-off process.\r\n\r\nThere is no guarantee of work, nor does the Authority guarantee any volume or specific value of work.  There is no exclusivity permitted and the Authority are not bound to the use of the Accreditation List for any or all requirements.\r\n\r\nThis advert relates to Round 1 only. Another advert will be posted for the procedure for Round 2 onwards. Also see Section 5 of the Accreditation List Instructions document.\r\n\r\nPlease visit the Council&#039;s e-tendering system https://www.eastmidstenders.org where you can express interest and obtain the documents, (please note we will only accept expressions of interest through the e-tendering system).

Well maintained and well used buildings help support teaching and learning and provide welcoming and inspirational spaces for our learners. We have a unique mix of urban and rural sites spanning across the South of Staffordshire.\r\nAs the popularity and size of South Staffordshire College grows, the College will evolve with new ways of teaching and working being explored, new technologies being adopted, and the demands of our stakeholders increasing. South Staffordshire College&#039;s portfolio of land and property assets must also change and improve. The refreshed Property Strategy will provide a broad vision for our future curriculum delivery and space management in one document. \r\nThe Property Strategy will emerge from a process of engagement with College stakeholders such as Board members, delivery and support staff, students, partners and customers.  To support the delivery of our Property Strategy, a Property Strategy Support is required to manage the production of the Strategy itself, plus any subsequent projects that the College chooses to implement from the Strategy.",

The advocates will serve as spokespeople for the programme, sharing community-based resources, as well as their personal mental health and wellbeing experiences and support mechanisms, specifically related to the NHS 5 Ways to Wellbeing themes:\r\n      o Connect with other people \r\n      o Be physically active  \r\n      o Learn new skills \r\n      o Give to others  \r\n      o Pay attention to the present moment (mindfulness)\r\n      \r\n      Leveraging these testimonials, as well as those collected from event attendees, the programme will promote a new, comprehensive digital repository/platform, where Birmingham residents can explore community-based resources, discover new ways to support their mental health and wellbeing, and share their own mental health and wellbeing experiences and support mechanisms, uploading personal testimonials and accompanying photographs to the repository/platform.\r\n      \r\n      Target Audience\r\n      \r\n      All citizens of Birmingham with special emphasis on \r\n      \r\n      o Individuals from Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Black British, Black Caribbean, and Black African backgrounds, and\r\n      o LGBTQ+ communities \r\n      \r\n      because these populations are disproportionally impacted by mental health and wellbeing inequalities, such as direct and indirect discrimination and access to care. \r\n      \r\n      The Mental Health &amp; Wellbeing Promotion Programme will begin on 27 January and end on 30 June 2025 and will be implemented in two distinct phases.\r\n      \r\n      The Council will be using its free to use e-tendering system (in-tend) for the administration of this procurement process and potential suppliers must register with the system to be able to express an interest.

It has consistently been awarded both Green Flag and Green Heritage award status and there are several external groups involved in providing volunteer maintenance and visitor activities. We have been welcoming visitors for nearly 20 years following creation of the park with a lottery grant and continue to maintain the site and facilities guided by our management plan.\r\nWe believe the site has the potential to be a bigger tourist and local resident destination with an all year round offering. \r\nThe Council is seeking an experienced operator who can add value to the sites offer to visitors and manage the visitor welcome and experience by operating the visitor centre and unlocking and locking the site at weekends and bank holidays, under an appropriate agreement commencing from 1 April 2025. \r\n\r\nThe Visitor Centre currently consists of:-\r\n•\tHeritage Displays\r\n•\tEnvironmental Displays\r\n•\tToilets\r\n•\tSmall Kitchen\r\nThe visitor centre is a single storey former cooperage adjacent to the car park and provides a good opportunity for a more commercially focused provider to deliver visitor welcome, interpretation and deliver a food &amp; beverage provision for the country park. The internal part of the building currently mainly houses heritage and environmental displays, with education/volunteer meeting space. \r\n\r\nBidders are advised to inspect the building and carefully consider the cost of reconfiguring the interior, providing catering equipment and any necessary works or for providing an alternative permanent or portable additional external catering unit, before submitting their EOI, especially considering the sites Scheduled status. It is anticipated that Planning Permission and Scheduled Ancient monument Consent will be required for significant changes or new additions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the key building, the Council is keen for the site to attract more visitors to the area, all year round, but in particular during the summer season. Innovative ideas are therefore sought on what additional offering could be created on the site. \r\n\r\nCont.",

We currently collect a variety of dry recycling materials on a fortnightly basis, which are sorted at kerbside. We are looking to purchase a new baler to be installed at our depot in Willand, which will serve both our current and future needs. Our current system automatically sorts co-mingled Mixed Plastic/steel and aluminium cans. We also have a sorting platform to enable manual separation of contaminants. A visit to site will be arranged for any companies interested in this tender. A maintenance contract is also need for the Baler and associated equipment. This tender will be in two Lots.",

Blackburn with Darwen has a unique environment and economy, which presents specific challenges to delivery of surfacing and civils schemes. \r\nIn addition, a significant investment programme in the town is leading to increased demand for new highways, changes to layouts and modern surface finishes.\r\nThe council has In house operational teams that carry out or supervise a variety of highway maintenance works across the borough. Maintaining the safety of the public and the Council&#039;s staff is a key consideration in delivering these works. Often these works require no provision of thermoplastic road markings. However, some of the works require replacement/renewal/removal of thermoplastic road markings that require equipment not held by the Council. In these circumstances, external contractors are procured to carry out these works. \r\nSome of this work will be regular, planned, routine and other work will be part of larger schemes.\r\nWorks should normally be carried out within 10 working days of receipt of the instruction from the council&#039;s Clients Representative, or his authorised officer.  \r\nHowever, there will be a requirement to provide thermoplastic road markings within a reduced timescale. \r\nThe majority of the work required will take place on highway authority roads with speed limits up  to 50mph; however contractors shall be competent to work on high speed roads up to 70mph when required.",

                "description": "The City Bridge Foundation is looking for a contractor to undertake the refurbishment of London&#039;s iconic Millennium Bridge. The project will include three key elements;\r\n\r\n1.\tThe resurfacing of the existing aluminium deck to improve slip resistance. The original aluminium deck is still in use. However, owing to high footfall over the bridge, the slip resistance of top surface of the deck has reduced and in some places the texture has completely worn away. The project will introduce a new surface coating to each deck plank to improve this slip resistance.\r\n2.\tRepainting of the steelwork. The bridge was last touched up in 2016 and the paint system in in generally good condition. The project will repaint all areas of steel (including some not previously painted).\r\n3.\tRe-tensioning of the suspension cables. This has not been completed before and will restore the profile of the central span following the initial relaxation of the cables and abutments. \r\nAs a key river crossing it is important that disruption to the users of the bridge is minimised throughout the work. Contractors are encouraged to explore alternative solutions and approaches to maximise the time that the bridge can remain in operation during the project. Details of alternative solutions should be included separately as part of your submission.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Millennium Bridge is a 325m long steel suspension footbridge, with a main span of 144m, spanning over the River Thames linking the City of London at St. Paul&#039;s Cathedral with the Tate Modern Gallery at Bankside. First opened in June 2000, the bridge was closed almost immediately due to the excessive swaying movement of the structure caused by synchronised walking action from large groups of pedestrians. After investigations, the bridge was re-opened to the public in February 2002 with significant modifications added such as tuned mass dampers, to reduce both vertical and horizontal vibrations, and viscous dampers to resist the sway movements of the bridge. \r\nThe bridge is supported on very shallow suspension cables on each side of the bridge made of 4 locked coil strands, each of 120mm diameter. The cable has a span to dip ratio of 63:1. The cables are anchored at each abutment and pass over two river piers. The cables support a deck formed from steel longitudinal beams which are supported on transverse arms which clamp on to the cable at each side at 8m intervals. The steel deck supports aluminium decking panels which span transversely 3.6m over the majority of the length of the bridge until the deck bifurcates at the southern abutment. There are movement joints in the deck at 16m centres.\r\n\r\nAbout City Bridge Foundation\r\nCity Bridge Foundation is a world class bridge owner and London&#039;s biggest independent charity funder.\r\nOur charity, City Bridge Foundation, was set up around 900 years ago for the maintenance of the old London Bridge. Our primary aim remains to maintain our five bridges - Tower, London,",

The number of pupils with such needs fluctuates given the mobile nature of the MOD population.  There can be as many as 15 such pupils across MOD schools.  To meet our organisation&#039;s vision, Educate the Child - Support the Family - Defend the Nation&quot;, we will be providing support to those children in settings and across global geographical locations. Therefore, during the period of the contract the successful provider must be able to demonstrate a flexible response to variable need across variable locations.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe children, their parents and the staff in schools require professional support and advice from suitably qualified education professionals, i.e., specialist HI or VI qualifications in addition to teaching qualifications. DCS does not employ such specialists due to the low incidence of need and therefore has a requirement to contract in the resource.   \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe specialist education professionals will be expected to provide regular support, advice and guidance to children/young people with sensory difficulties, their parents and teaching staff as required in the various locations across DCS. The aim is to ensure children/young people with sensory difficulties can access and receive high quality inclusive education alongside their peers, reach their educational potential and are not disadvantaged from their time spent abroad. That support would include direct work with children and parents as well as contribution to planning and review.  They would also liaise with any other external agencies the children are involved in such as Speech and Language Therapists. ",

                "description": "The Authority currently uses a MPLS WAN made up of fibre circuits (see MPLS LOCATIONS below) with varying bandwidths, ranging from 10Mbps to 1000Mbps on varying bearers. We require a /29 subnet at each site.\r\n      \r\n      The devices and systems within the internal LAN are a culmination of switches, computers, AP&#039;s, Servers and some small scale CCTV systems. The number of devices connected will vary depending on the size of the site. The Head Office at Myddelton House will have the most with approx. 300 devices connected. Our current handoff is Ethernet. \r\n      \r\n      The Authority currently has an on-premise server estate spread across two locations (data centre and at Head Office). As part of this tender we want to move to a fully virtualised environment as this will provide improved resilience and reliability.\r\n      \r\n      We are now looking for a turnkey solution for a new secure Wide Area Network with and virtualising our server estate onto a hosted cloud platform.\r\n      \r\n      In terms of bandwidth requirements, we require scalable bandwidth ranging from a minimum of 100Mbps and maximum of 1000Mpbs bearer across our estate. See table 1 in Appendix A for full details. We host ad-hoc events at some of the locations of varying durations. It is therefore important that we have the ability to increase and decrease bandwidth as and when required without penalty charges or admin fees via a self-service portal. Table 1 below sets out our required circuits and bandwidth provision.\r\n      \r\n      We are looking for the capability for allowing remote users to access the WAN via IPsec VPN. The max concurrent VPN users is 100.\r\n      \r\n      We currently have an Active/Passive setup so would not be looking to change this; but are looking for the bidder to provide a solution that meets the needs as set out in the specification and that is the most effective in terms of cost and resilience.\r\n      \r\n      In terms of servers, we have hardware at our existing COLO so plan is to move physical server infrastructure to a virtualised PaaS/IaaS platform. The successful tenderer will be required to manage this as part of the turnkey solution.",

                "description": "In the first year of Heritage 2033, the Heritage Fund designed a new Impact Framework to allow the Heritage Fund to evaluate and assess the impact of our funding over the next 10 years. Work is underway to introduce qualitative and quantitative measures which will be used to understand if we are delivering against the long-term ambitions of our strategy. Alongside the development of this Impact Framework, the senior team wish to improve the approach to performance measurement and reporting through a revision of the suite of management information and key performance indicators that inform decision making and help senior management with oversight of delivery. Management information (MI) in this context refers to data that is used by the Heritage Fund to help make decisions about how the organisation is run. MI can take the form of reports, charts and graphs; but it should allow performance to be tracked over time. Areas of the MI are already under development covering financial, operational and workforce measures, however there is a need to develop regular reporting on customer satisfaction and stakeholder reputation. We are seeking a service provider who will work with the Heritage Fund to develop the MI for customer satisfaction and stakeholder reputation drawing on existing sources of information at the Heritage Fund as well as wider best practice. The provider will then recommend a series of Gold/Silver/Bronze level options for future information and measures that could be delivered using existing systems without significant additional investment.",

                "description": "Goring-on-Thames Parish Council invites proposals from suitably qualified companies to design and re-develop the play facilities on the Bourdillon Field recreation ground behind Goring Primary School (RG8 0BG). \r\n\r\nThe existing playground consists of a fenced-in area and a grass mound in the middle. In addition, there is also an unfenced area adjacent to the playground with a combined basketball net and football goal. It is intended to extend and refurbish/redesign both areas.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\nThe design of the playground should take into consideration the surroundings and should appeal to a wide age group - from toddler to year 6 primary (2-12 years). The open sports area should be suitable for an older age group. Suppliers should use their expert knowledge to recommend specific equipment, surfacing and a design to optimise use of the area available, including Accessible and SEN friendly elements.\r\n\r\nThe playground should be themed with a large structure to denote the theme and to be the centrepiece. The proposals should include, to the extent possible given the physical layout, play-frames, slides, multiple swing sets, a multipurpose roundabout/turntable specifically accessible for wheelchair access, tactile/sensory play activities, log weavers / balance beams and challenging 'risky' play equipment, zip wire. The existing mound area should be utilised or enhanced as an integral part of the design. \r\n\r\nIf suitable within the design and if there is space available, suppliers should include risky play: climbing frames, walk-ways, climbing walls, net/rope climbing frames, pyramid rope climbing frame, tactile/ sensory play: e.g. ball runs, glockenspiel/musical play and other items to stand up at and interact with and tunnels.\r\n\r\nExisting fencing should be retained if cost effective and extended and re-finished. Existing play equipment, benches etc should be refurbished and/or re-used if suppliers can do so cost effectively within their design concepts. \r\n\r\nThe basketball/goal open sports area will be retained but suppliers should include the cost of replacing it with better and more modern equipment. The existing floor area will be enlarged and resurfaced.\r\n\r\nSuppliers should include proposals for suitable access paths to the playground gates. \r\n\r\nHow to apply:\r\n\r\nSubmissions should be made by 3pm on Friday 7th February 2025 to:\r\n\r\nThe Clerk, Goring-on-Thames Parish Council, The Old School, Station Rd, Reading, RG8 9HB.\r\n\r\nAll tenders must be signed by a named company director, dated and returned in a sealed envelope marked 'Private and Confidential - Goring on Thames Playgrounds' to the above address by post, courier or hand delivered. Any tenders delivered by hand must be signed as received by the Parish Clerk, Assistant Clerk or nominated Councillor. \r\n\r\nIn addition, suppliers should provide an electronic copy of the submission to clerk@goringparishcouncil.gov.uk, subject line \"Private and confidential - Goring on Thames Playgrounds\".",
